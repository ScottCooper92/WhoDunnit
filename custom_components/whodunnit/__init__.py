"""
Whodunnit  -  Home Assistant Custom Integration
__init__.py: Integration setup and teardown

This file is the entry point for the Whodunnit integration. It is called by HA
when a config entry is loaded, reloaded, or deleted.

Responsibilities:
  - Register shared global event listeners (once, on first entry load) that
    populate a single context cache for all WhodunnitSensor instances
  - Resolve the target entity to its parent device (if any)
  - Keep the config entry title in sync with the target entity's friendly name
  - Follow entity_id renames of the target (migrating the entry and sensor
    unique IDs) and remove the entry when the target is deleted from HA,
    mirroring core helper integrations such as switch_as_x
  - Build the DeviceInfo that sensor.py uses to attach its sensor to the
    correct device card in the HA UI
  - Create a virtual "Whodunnit" device for Helper entities that have no
    physical device of their own (e.g. input_boolean, input_select)
  - Forward setup to the sensor platform
  - Clean up virtual devices when an entry is permanently deleted
  - Tear down shared listeners when the last entry is unloaded
